This is a small program used to controle the cpu by making it wait to output the string instead of doing it as soon as we run the program, every 10 seconds its supposed to print hello

the goal of this program is to make the cpu wait before printing the input that the user enters into the command line. This is a form of cpu controle.
if the user enters nothing than an error message is output
